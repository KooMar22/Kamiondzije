# Kamiondzije_Game
This little arcade game was inspired by the theme song of "Kamiond≈æije" TV show: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206492/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_kamiond  Made possible after passing this guide: https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/
Of course, I have followed the logic of this guide, but with my own code creation / adjustments.

CONTROLS:
UP - go up
DOWN - go down
LEFT - go left
RIGHT - go right
SPACE - pause and unpause the game
LEFT SHITF = change song
ESCAPE - quit the game

You can view the code and also play it by downloading the installer.
